# GARCH-Modeling-of-SBI-Stock-Volatility-1996-2024-
This project demonstrates end-to-end GARCH modeling of daily SBI (SBIN.NS) stock returns (1996–2024) in R. Includes data download, cleaning, volatility diagnostics, comparison of GARCH-type models, out-of-sample forecasting, and clear interpretation—ideal for robust financial risk modeling.
# GARCH Modeling of SBI Stock Volatility (1996–2024)

This repository demonstrates how to apply the GARCH family of models to real-world financial time series — specifically, SBIN (State Bank of India, NSE: SBIN.NS) daily close prices from 1996 to 2024. The project covers every step from data acquisition and cleaning through model fitting, diagnostics, and out-of-sample forecasting, all implemented in R.

## Overview

Financial return series show volatility clustering and time-varying variance, which motivates the use of GARCH-family models. This repository gives a full example workflow: **from raw price data to robust volatility model selection and validation** for SBI's daily returns.

## Workflow

### Data Acquisition and Cleaning

- Download daily close prices for SBIN.NS from Yahoo.
- Remove any missing data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Visualize price and return series.
- Plot ACF/PACF to examine autocorrelation structures.
- Convert prices to log returns for stationarity and modeling.

### Stationarity Testing

- Perform ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) tests to verify stationarity of log returns.

### Volatility Diagnostics

- Plot squared returns to visually inspect volatility clustering.
- Apply ARCH tests to confirm presence of volatility effects.
- Use Ljung-Box tests and ACF plots of squared returns.

### GARCH Model Fitting

- Fit and compare several models:
    - **GARCH(1,1)**
    - **GARCH(1,2)**
    - **GARCH-M (GARCH-in-Mean)**
    - **TGARCH/GJR-GARCH** (asymmetry/leverage)
    - **EGARCH** (handles leverage, log volatility)
- Use the `rugarch` package for estimation.

### Model Diagnostics & Comparison

- Evaluate residual autocorrelation, ARCH effects, and sign bias.
- Compare fit using information criteria (AIC/BIC/HQIC) via `infocriteria()`.
- Visualize information criteria for all models side-by-side.
- Plot and inspect residuals and conditional volatility fits.

### Forecasting

- Generate and evaluate 10-day ahead out-of-sample volatility forecasts.
- Report forecast error metrics (MSE, MAE) and directional accuracy.
- Visualize forecasted volatility.

## Key Results

- **Returns are stationary**; prices are not.
- Strong evidence of **volatility clustering** and **ARCH effects**.
- **GARCH(1,2)** with constant mean yields the best fit by AIC/BIC/HQIC, but other advanced GARCH models perform nearly as well.
- All models capture volatility clustering; however, residuals remain fat-tailed—consider t-distributed innovations for improved tail risk modeling.
- **Out-of-sample volatility forecasts**: low forecast error, but predicting the direction of daily returns remains, as expected, near chance.

## How to Replicate

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the main `.R` script or notebook.
3. Run each section in order.
4. Experiment with different GARCH specifications, error distributions, or forecast lengths as desired.
5. All plots, tables, and model results can be generated by following the code.
